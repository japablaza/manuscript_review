# Review TPP

## Summary
- I would prefer to start with the Appendix rather than Chap01
- The test suite give you a nice path to achieve the purpose of the program
- Pattern repeated in the book. Good for a module
- Chap 02 and 03 need the right numbering

## Chap 01
- test_ shows multiple variable assignments. Pretty cool
- out.trip() == 'Hello, Worlds!'. Pretty cool
- 1.7: Typo 'reaons'
- 1.7: Scrip is repeated
- 1.8: "positional" and are usually required and so do not have default values.
- 1.10: community standards and expectations. Pretty cool
- 1.11: organizing the code to group ideas together
- 1.12: make: Pretty cool

## Chap 02
- statusoutput, getoutput. Pretty cool
- test.py: test_vowel_upper() should be test_vowel_title()
- 1.1.1: Typo in the point number 2
- maybe capitalize() could be better than title() in test.py
- If expression. Pretty cool
- 1.3.1: Hard to understand the 'return parser.parse_args()'

## Chap 03
- Using 'assert'. Pretty cool.
- 1.1: nargs='+' 'One or more of the same positional arguments Chapter 2' is should be Appendix A.4.5
- 1.3.7: list.sort() and sorted
- Hints: nargs is part of Appendix A.4.5

## Chap 04
-

## Chap 05
-

## Chap 06
- 6.1.1: In the last paragraph 'File arguments' is not from Chapter 2
